### Hi there, I'm ChristinaðŸ‘‹


I'm a full stack web developer currently based in Birmingham, UK ðŸ˜„

I began my wonderful journey into code in January 2021, kickstarted by the brilliant [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk).
Prior to the School of Code, I had not written a single line of code before. 

In 13 weeks, I went from writing my first console.log("hello world") to building a full stack web app in two weeks - checkout [CartShop](https://cartshop.netlify.app/)! Since then, I've been working on my own projects which I'll be showcasing on my github page. 

I'm now looking for new opportunties to further my skills ðŸŒ±
